# Sublime IndentationNavigation plugin

This is glorious plugin that allow to navigate through text using indentation of
lines. It reduce count of typing drastically when managing or navigating through
blocks of code.

package.

### Usage

There is several handy usecases (please see keyboard shortcuts in "commands"
section below):

1. Go to out of indentation - when cursor is in "if" or "for" block hit keyboard
shortcut to go to beginning or end of this block.

  ```
  if condition
    statement1 # <- cursor at this line
    statement2
  |end # <- cursor here after executing command
  ```

2. Go to into next indented block

  ```
  statement1 # <- cursor at this line
  statement2

  |if condition # <- cursor here after executing command
    ...
  end
  ```

3. Go to end of next indented block

  ```
  statement1 # <- cursor at this line
  statement2

  if condition
    ...
  |end # <- cursor here after executing command
  ```

4. Select to next indented block

  ```
  | # <- cursor here
  {statement1
  statement2} # <- block will be selected after executing command

  if condition
    ...
  end
  ```

5. Select up to next indented block

  ```
  | # <- cursor here
  {statement1
  statement2

  if condition
    ...
  end} # <- block will be selected after executing command
  ```

6. Select current indented block to the end

  ```
  if condition
    statement1
    | # <- cursor here
    {statement2
    statement3} # <- block will be selected after executing command
  end
  ```

7. Select current indentation - provides ability to select current indentation
that works a bit better that sublime's default "expand_selection" {"to":
"indentation"}

Backward versions of function is useless when working with languages that use
indentation to define code blocks (python, cofee) :(
